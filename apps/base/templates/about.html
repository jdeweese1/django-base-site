        <p class="inline"> I'm Jarod DeWeese, a Computer Science Student at Kansas State University. I grew up in the small(ish) Kansas town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt%2C_Kansas">Pratt</a> which is actually in the middle of nowhere. Currently I'm a Student Developer for <a href="https://www.pears.oeie.org">PEARS</a> at the <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/oeie/">OEIE</a> at K-State. Additionally, I am an avid podcast listener, my favorite being the <a href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> hosted by <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment,</a> <a href="http://caseyliss.com">Casey Liss</a>, and <a href="http://hypercritical.co/">John Siracusa</a>. I've also been know to enjoy <a href="relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a>, <a href="http://dobyfriday.com">Do By Friday</a>, <a href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet</a>, <a href="https://relay.fm/topfour">Top Four</a>, and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a>. All of these podcasts are pretty heavily focused on Apple and technology, and they first got me interested in tech.
        </p>
		<h3>My setup, I should probably make this into a blog post at some point</h3>
        <p>Because I am a total nerd, I love find cool software to make my life easier. One such app that I love to use is <a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a>. BTT is a powerful tool  designed to automate/create shortcuts for the Mac. I use BTT everyday for things such as: rebinding key commands and trackpad gestures, running terminal commands, inserting custom text, or rearranging windows. This may seem really overwhelming at first, but given enough time, I think it can become any Mac power user's best friend. Even though I use BTT daily, I still barely even scratch the surface of what it's capable of.
        </p>
        <p>Another such app is called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine.</a> I use Amphetamine to keep my Mac from ever automatically going to sleep. If you want to be a real power user, there are many switches to flip in it's preferences.</p>
        <p>How could I not mention my email client of choice? It's Airmail, both on the desktop and on mobile. I love all the features put into it, and the iCloud sync feature, along with email sorting rules.</p>
		<p>Also <a href="https://agilebits.com">1Password</a> is my password manager of choice and it honestly makes my life so much better and secure everyday. Living without a proper password manager is just crazy, like staring into the eye of madness.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> is my text editor of choice, and <a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/"> Sublime Merge</a> is my Git Gui of choice.</p> Here's some of my Command Line Tools that I <strong>must</strong> have to work on a computer <a>Homebrew</a>, <a>FFMPEG</a>, <a>youtube-dl</a>.
		<p>In terms of shells, I'm a strong propnent of <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> and zsh.</p>
    </div>

		<p> I'm absolutely a person that must have creative side projects to stay busy, in the past they have ranged from photography, graphic design, writing, and cooking.

		<p>
			This site is built with Django, a Python framework for web application development. The skeleton of this project comes from <a href="https://github.com/epicserve/django-base-site">Brent O'Connor's Django Base Site.</a> By making some modifications, like adding a <a href="{% url 'contact:site_contact' %}">contact</a> form, <a href="{%  url 'blogs:blog_index' %}">blog</a>, and corresponding admin forms.</p>
