        <p>Hi, I'm Jarod.</p><p> I'm a Computer Science Student at Kansas State University. I grew up in the small(ish) Kansas town of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt%2C_Kansas">Pratt</a> which is actually in the middle of nowhere. Currently I'm a Student Developer for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pears.oeie.org">PEARS</a> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.k-state.edu/oeie/">OEIE</a> at K-State. Additionally, I am an avid podcast listener, my favorite being the <a target="_blank" href="http://atp.fm">Accidental Tech Podcast</a> hosted by <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment,</a> <a href="http://caseyliss.com">Casey Liss</a>, and <a href="http://hypercritical.co/">John Siracusa</a>. I've also been know to enjoy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.relay.fm/mpu">Mac Power Users</a>, <a href="http://dobyfriday.com">Do By Friday</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://relay.fm/topfour">Top Four</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a>. All of these podcasts are pretty heavily focused on Apple and technology, and they first got me interested in tech.
        </p>
		<p>In addition to podcasts I'm also a huge music lover. My favorite genres of music are indie-rock, 80s synth pop, and disco. My favorite recent album is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5Nzqg5Xb7xaKfl3XudeNiY?si=nYHKTZYoS7iH96V4afuaFA">Sun Machine</a>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubblebucket">Rubblebucket</a>. Some of my favorite go to artists include: Weezer, Cut Copy, De Lux, VHS Collection, Hercules and Love Affair and Pet Shop Boys. My taste in music is exemplified by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jaroddeweese/playlist/7zKKjTkUuzxZT7dm1p3ZuD?si=LikLPZ03Q2aQni0xKzy0Gg">this</a> playlist.

		<h1 class="display-4 text-center">My current setup</h1>
        <p>Because I am a total nerd, I love find cool software to make my life easier. One such app that I love to use is <a target="_blank" href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a>. BTT is a powerful tool  designed to automate/create shortcuts for the Mac. I use BTT everyday for things such as: rebinding key commands and trackpad gestures, running terminal commands, inserting custom text, or rearranging windows. This may seem really overwhelming at first, but given enough time, I think it can become any Mac power user's best friend. Even though I use BTT daily, I still barely even scratch the surface of what it's capable of.
        </p>
        <p>Another such app is called <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12">Amphetamine.</a> I use Amphetamine to keep my Mac from ever automatically going to sleep. If you want to be a real power user, there are many switches to flip in it's preferences.</p>
        <p>How could I not mention my email client of choice? It's Airmail, both on the desktop and on mobile. I love all the features put into it, and the iCloud sync feature, along with email sorting rules.</p>
		<p>Also <a target="_blank" href="https://agilebits.com">1Password</a> is my password manager of choice and it honestly makes my life so much better and secure everyday. Living without a proper password manager is just crazy, like staring into the eye of madness.</p>

		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> is my text editor of choice, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/"> Sublime Merge</a> is my Git Gui of choice.</p> Here's some of my Command Line Tools that I <strong>must</strong> have to work on a computer are <a target="_blank" href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</a>.

		<p>In terms of shells, I'm a strong propnent of <a target="_blank" href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> </p>

		<p>As a developer, <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> has become my new favorite app for documentation. It automagically pulls in API docsets from Django, Python, Bootstrap, Node and more!</p>

		<p>I'm a regular user of <a href="https://macpaw.com/cleanmydrive">CleanMyDrive2</a>. It allows you to easily see and clean junk on your Mac's drives. It's made by <a href="https://macpaw.com/">MacPaw</a>, who is really good about making really good software. </p>
		<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is a fantastic replacement for Spotlight on the Mac.</p>
